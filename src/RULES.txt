MAKING ROLLS:
Use D100, if you roll lesser or equal than your attribute, you win.
If the roll is difficult you may gain Boons. For each Boon roll D6, on 6 automatically win the roll, regardless of D100 roll.
If the roll is difficult you may gain Banes. For each Boon roll D6, on 1 automatically lose the roll, regardless of D100 roll.
Boons and Banes cancel each other out.

COMBAT AND ACTIONS:
Combat is divided into players round and enemy round.
During players turn, players take actions in any order.
During enemy turn, enemies take actions in any order.
Players round is first, however players roll for initiative. If they lose, they do not gain Standard Action turn 1.
Players during their turn can perform: Move Action and Standard Action in this order. They also can use Swift Action once per turn.
