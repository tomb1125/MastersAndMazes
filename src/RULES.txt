MAKING ROLLS:
Use D100, if you roll lesser or equal than your attribute, you win.
If the roll is difficult you may gain Boons. For each Boon roll D6, on 6 automatically win the roll, regardless of D100 roll.
If the roll is difficult you may gain Banes. For each Boon roll D6, on 1 automatically lose the roll, regardless of D100 roll.
Boons and Banes cancel each other out.
