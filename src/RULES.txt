MAKING ROLLS:
Use D100, if you roll lesser or equal than your attribute, you win.
If the roll is difficult you may gain Boons. For each Boon roll D6, on 6 automatically win the roll, regardless of D100 roll.
If the roll is difficult you may gain Banes. For each Boon roll D6, on 1 automatically lose the roll, regardless of D100 roll.
Boons and Banes cancel each other out.

COMBAT AND ACTIONS:
Combat is divided into players round and enemy round.
During players turn, players take actions in any order.
During enemy turn, enemies take actions in any order.
Players round is first, however players roll for initiative (this is Dexterity check). If they lose, they do not gain Standard Action turn 1.
Players during their turn can perform once each of following actions: Move Action, Standard Action and Swift Action.

Move Action is used to move your character by their speed, usually by 6 meters.
Standard Action is used mostly to attack and perform other key actions
Swift Action is used to perform actions of lesser importance: drinking potion, changing weapon.

EFFECTS:
Unless specified otherwise all effects stacks. Each instance of effect have to be tracked separately. 
Eg. you hit twice with an effect that grants you +5 damage for 3 turns. Yoy have two instances of +5 damage effect,
which effectively means you deal +10 damage for 3 turns.
Whenever ability can repeat, note that repeats cannot loop.

HEALTH AND DYING:
After each combat regain all Mana.
After rest (8 hours with sleep) regain 10 Health

When you are reduced to 0 HP, gain 1 Experience Point and roll for dying: Roll D10 and add number of your Scars:
1-9 - You become unconscious  until end of combat. After combat regain 1 HP and gain 1 Scar.
10 - You rally! Set your HP to 1 and until start of your turn you have 30% chance to ignore any damage.
11-20 - roll D10 again: 1-3 you die, 4-10 you rally as above.
21+ - roll D10 again: 1-7 you die, 8-10 you rally as above. (note that this is almost impossible to reach this level)
